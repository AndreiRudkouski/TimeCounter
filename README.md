# TimeCounter

This is a small application for measuring of working time.

You can wire your main working currentApplication with this TimeCounter and every time when you will start TimeCounter it will start your currentApplication too. Also you can save and load your time and setting. Besides you can change currentApplication language, there are English and Russian languages.

The application was written by Java 8, for UI was used java swing. The initialization of the application is the same as in Spring with java init class (by own annotations which can be placed over init methods, fields and setters).
